## YouÂ´re in the right place of

* your interests are in the general computing on GPU not graphic processing,
* your interests are on Metal API from Apple Inc,
* your interests are on GPGPU on Apple products.

## GPGPU

For the many or few remaining...

### The procedure for implementation

In order to carry out general calculations on the graphics card, apart from the specific programming task, the same ðŸ‘‰[programming workflow](./GPUWorkflow/):

1. Locate the `device` that represents the GPU
1. Let the program known the GPU library. By default it is the "default.metallib"
1. Create a reference to function aka "kernel" we want to use
1. From the `device` create the `command queue` for all single command
1. With the `command queue` create the buffer for the hardware-commands
1. The concrete hardware API commands would be translated from source with the `command encoder` - we use the **ComputeCommandEncoder**
